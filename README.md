# Sorting-Algorithms #

A collection of sorting algorithms implemented in C language. Algorithms included are:

* Bubble Sort (-bubble)
* Recursive Bubble Sort (-bubblerec)
* Insertion Sort (-insertion)
* Recursive Insertion Sort (-insertionrec)
* Binary Insertion Sort (-binary)
* Selection Sort (-selection)
* Merge Sort (-merge)
* Quick Sort (-quick)
* Heap Sort (-heap)


Makefile included for compiling with the command 'make'. Output file named 'sorting' with 2 arguments, which first one is the algorithm oo your choice and the second the size of the array to sort. e.g sorting -selection 1000 for a 1000 elements array to be sorted by Selection Algorithm
